# RL-AI-in-Supply-chain-management
This project involves training an AI using Reinforcement Learning (DQN) for inventory and supply chain management.

Considered Supply Chain Models:

    1. Single Echelon Supply Chain
    2. Two-Echelon Supply Chain

Evaluation Metrics:

    1. Inventory Cost Only (single echelon)
    2. Inventory Cost and Capacity Cost (single echelon)
    3. Inventory Cost Only (two echelon)
    4. Inventory Cost and Capacity Cost (two echelon)
Instructions:

For the single echelon case, run the script main.py.
For the two echelon case, run the script main_2.py.
